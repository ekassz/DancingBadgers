# DancingBadgers
Created a program of a perfect size array of badger images.
Going through a for loop, a badger gets drawn up to 5 times by clicking key 'b' and 'B'.
Once the badger image is drawn on the screen, you can hover over it with your mouse, click it and drag it along the screen wherever you want.
If you want to then get rid of a badger, hover over it, and either click the key 'r' or 'R'.
